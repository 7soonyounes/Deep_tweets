# Deep Tweets: Politics vs Sports Classification

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify tweets into two categories: politics and sports. The classification is done using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression and XGBoost models. The project follows a structured workflow that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text vectorization using TF-IDF, and model training and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several main sections:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Read the raw data from the dataset.
   - Check for and handle any null or missing values.
   - Perform data cleaning, including removing special characters and unwanted symbols.
   - Tokenize the text data into individual words.
   - Convert all words to lowercase.
   - Remove stop words to reduce noise in the data.
   - Lemmatize words to reduce inflections.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Check the balance between the two classes (politics and sports) in the dataset.
   - Visualize the class distribution using plots (e.g., bar charts).
   - Analyze the frequency of words within each label using word clouds or bar plots.
   
3. **Text Vectorization (TF-IDF):**
   - Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.
   
4. **Modeling:**
   - Train a logistic regression model on the TF-IDF transformed data.
   - Train an XGBoost model as an alternative classifier.
   
5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of both models using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
   
6. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize the results and insights gained from the project.
   - Reflect on the effectiveness of the models and suggest potential improvements.
